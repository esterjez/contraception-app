        <h2>Contraceptive Use Among Slovak Adolescents</h2>

        <section style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <p>
            This chart presents the self-reported use of condoms and birth control pills among Slovak adolescents who have had sexual intercourse, based on survey data from 2014 and 2018. 
            The results show not only the prevalence of contraceptive use, but also the percentage of respondents who reported not using these methods, or were unsure about their usage ("don’t know").
            </p>

            <h3>Trends in Contraceptive Use</h3>
            <p>
            Condom use remains the most commonly reported method of contraception, with a noticeable increase between 2014 and 2018. This could reflect greater awareness, better accessibility, or improved sex education during that period. 
            Meanwhile, the use of birth control pills also increased slightly, but a significant proportion of adolescents either did not use this method or were unsure whether they did.
            </p>

            <h3>Important Insight</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #003366;">
            The relatively high number of “don’t know” responses—especially for the pill—highlights a potential gap in understanding contraceptive methods and how they are used. 
            This suggests a need for more comprehensive and accessible sexual education that equips young people with accurate information to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>
            Understanding these trends is essential for educators, policymakers, and public health professionals aiming to support safe and informed sexual behavior among adolescents. 
            Better education and resources can lead to healthier choices and reduce risks associated with unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.

        <h2>Sexual Activity Among Slovak Adolescents</h2>
        <p>
            This chart shows the percentage of Slovak adolescents—divided by gender—who reported having had sexual intercourse in 2014 and 2018. The results reveal a slight decline in reported sexual activity over time for both boys and girls.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2014, about 18.3% of boys and 14.2% of girls reported having had sex. By 2018, these numbers decreased to 17.0% for boys and 11.3% for girls. This shift may reflect changes in behavior, education, or attitudes toward sexuality and relationships among adolescents.
        </p>
        <p>
            The consistent gender difference—boys reporting higher rates of sexual activity than girls—could also point to cultural or social norms influencing how adolescents respond to sensitive survey questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding these trends is key to tailoring sexual education programs and ensuring that both boys and girls are equally informed and supported in making healthy choices regarding their sexuality.
